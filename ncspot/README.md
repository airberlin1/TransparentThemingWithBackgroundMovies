This assumes that you only have one ncspot instance running at a time. To send the reload shortcut to all ncspot windows, look at the kitty implementation.
Also, `Spotify` is not the standard class name. I changed it for me as I have some startup scripts for ncspot to make the music visible on discord. You probably have to change the way this script finds the ncspot window.
